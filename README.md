### Hello Visitor ðŸ‘‹
I'm Rubens but you can call me Junior! 
I love making things easier with automations and there is no better tools nowadays then our beloved Python and it's children; Beautiful Soup, Scrapy and Selenium ! (With whom I'v been working with for about 3 years)
Flask and some friends like Javascript, CSS and HTML are known to me as well as a bit of Django.

### What Now?
These days I'm trying to understand the usability of Cython on APIs optmization and on how it can improve this tools that I already use. 
Oh ! I'm looking for a job currently as well, so please contact me if you have a challenge for me.
